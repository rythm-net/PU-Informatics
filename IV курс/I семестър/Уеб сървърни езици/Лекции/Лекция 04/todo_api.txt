Todo rest_api:

1. When creating new Todo for user:
   - set TodoStatus = IN_PROGRESS if first Todo for the TeamMember
   - set TdooStatus = NOT_STARTED when the team member has one or more Todos already
   - Find last Todo and update nextTodo to point to the newly created Object in order to create sequence of Todos to be executed
2. Add api endpoint markAsDone/<todo id>:
   - POST to the endpoint will mark the todo as DONE and update the next todo to IN_PROGRESS
